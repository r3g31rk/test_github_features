## WIP

### Broken link checker

what I tested:

- some premade actions from the github
  - mlc => could not make it work properly
  - [lychee-action](https://github.com/lycheeverse/lychee-action)
  - [makdown link checker](https://github.com/gaurav-nelson/github-action-markdown-link-check)
  - [linkinator-action](https://github.com/JustinBeckwith/linkinator-action)
